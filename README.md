# Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks 
ESRGAN is a state-of-the-art deep learning model designed for high-quality image super-resolution. Building on the success of SRGAN, ESRGAN improves visual quality by employing a more powerful generator network, a perceptual loss function based on the features of a pre-trained VGG network, and a discriminator with Relativistic Average GAN to better differentiate between real and generated images. ESRGAN is particularly effective at enhancing image details and textures, making it widely used in applications requiring high-resolution images, such as digital media, gaming, and image restoration tasks.
